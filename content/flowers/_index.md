description: Flowers by Jennifer is a floral artistry wedding and event company in NH. With a background of over 25 years in the Arts,  owner and head designer Jennifer uses that to fuel her creativity and unique designs. When she began dabbling in creative floral design it originally started as a form of self care and therapy in early 2022. She needed an outlet to calm her  soul and mind, so she turned to gardening then gardening turned into arrangements, arrangements turned into art...you get the picture! Jennifer’s background also has given her the unique ability to connect with most people on a deep level, which helps her designs to be more personal to each couple. It’s a gift to be able to share such special moments with people, hear their stories and in turn create florals to match their essence. It’s truly something that is not taken for granted and because of that our creations stay fresh and unique. Our staff also has a collective background in teaching, facilitating and directing. We use that skill when we offer floral workshops, designing and coordinating your event. If you are looking for a fun bachelorette idea or want to have a relaxing community event, then one of our workshops is a great option! We guide you on how to arrange a lovely vased bouquet and then you can take it home to enjoy! For more information please do not hesitate to visit our website and reach out with questions!
