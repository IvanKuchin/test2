description: Hello! My name is Jennifer and I am the owner and primary Floral Designer here at Flowers by Jennifer! I have always been a nature lover and HUGE fan of flowers all my life. I wanted to share a bit about my background and what led me to this chapter. I have been a professional working artist in the arts for the last 25 years, and have always been drawn creatively to many different artistic mediums. I enjoy painting, singing, acting, teaching, wire wrapping...you name it! When I began dabbling in creative floral design it originally started as a form of self care and therapy in early 2022. I needed an outlet to calm my soul and my mind, so I turned to gardening then gardening turned into arrangements, arrangements turned into art...you get the picture! My favorite part about working with flowers, are weddings and events! I love being able to share such special moments with people, hear their stories and in turn create florals to match their essence. It’s truly something I don’t take for granted and because of that my creations stay fresh and unique. www.flowersbyjennifer.com
