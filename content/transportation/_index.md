description: Hello! I am Natalia with Natalia Price Photography. After years of interest in photography as a beloved hobby, I decided in 2018 to leave my accounting/auditing career in NYC and pursue my obsession with beautiful imagery full time. In my photography, I strive to capture a clean and natural composition. Candid and in-the-moment shots are my favorite photos. I gently guide clients to comfortable poses, movements, activities that make for great photographs. I would love to create an image that you and your loved ones would cherish for years to come. I am currently based in Manchester, New Hampshire with my scientist husband and two young daughters who I frequently call upon to serve as models. Being able to photograph the life of my family is certainly a privilege. The early years run by so quickly, and the sleepless nights and the demanding parenting job make it even harder to remember the details and the magic of childhood. Luckily, I'm happy to say that I have it documented! Website www.nataliapricephotos.com
