description: Hello, I am Shashi, the proud owner of Cakes & Bakes, where every sweet creation tells a story of resilience and passion. My journey began amidst the whirlwind of postpartum depression, where the kitchen became my sanctuary and baking, my lifeline. Starting with simple treats for my children, I soon found solace in experimenting with recipes, infusing them with the vibrant flavors of my Indian heritage. Driven by a deep yearning for the tastes of home and a lack of similar offerings in my community, I set out to create something unique â€“ Indian fusion desserts that blended traditional flavors with modern techniques. With each batch, I discovered not only a way to heal but also an untapped talent for crafting mouthwatering delights that captured the essence of my culture. Today, as the heart and soul behind Cakes & Bakes, I continue to share my love for Indian fusion desserts with a growing community of customers. My style of baking is clean and minimalistic, but I also cater to whatever the Bride wants and always up for a good challenge. Go to Instagram for [more](@kkbakes2024)
