description: With over 8 years of experience as a makeup artist , I've learned all types of makeup including special effects, theatrical and beauty but my heart went to weddings. I love the environment of when brides are about to step in one of the biggest journeys of their life and I get to be a part of that. I have been married for 8 years to an amazing man and my biggest accomplishment is our 6 year old daughter whom my world revolves around. I received my makeup artist certification from  the Makeup School  of Candice Mack in Strasbourg, France in 2015 . I furthered my education by becoming a licensed Esthetician in 2022. I am also a certified lash and nail technician. Over the past few years, the natural makeup look has been my signature style that brides request but I can certainly do it all and enjoy a full glam! Whatever you have in mind we will work together to achieve it. I want you to feel yourself, feel comfortable andconfident! Go to Website for [more](www.lafrenchtouchbyemilie.com)
