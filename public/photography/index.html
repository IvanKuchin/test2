  <meta name="description" content="Hello! I am Natalia with Natalia Price Photography. After years of interest in photography as a beloved hobby, I decided in 2018 to leave my accounting/auditing career in NYC and pursue my obsession with beautiful imagery full time. In my photography, I strive to capture a clean and natural composition. Candid and in-the-moment shots are my favorite photos. I gently guide clients to comfortable poses, movements, activities that make for great photographs. I would love to create an image that you and your loved ones would cherish for years to come. I am currently based in Manchester, New Hampshire with my scientist husband and two young daughters who I frequently call upon to serve as models. Being able to photograph the life of my family is certainly a privilege. The early years run by so quickly, and the sleepless nights and the demanding parenting job make it even harder to remember the details and the magic of childhood. Luckily, I&#39;m happy to say that I have it documented! Go to website for [more](www.nataliapricephotos.com)" />
