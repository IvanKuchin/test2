          &lt;p&gt;Hi there! My name is Nikky Atkinson. I have been  in the beauty industry for over 10 years now. Before I ever knew that I would dive this deep into the world of making people pretty, the innate need to help people has always been there. It didn&#39;t really matter in what way, or how. It came instinctively. I also felt this intense need to create. Bringing beautiful things into existence is what I enjoy most. Combining these aspects together, with my desire for wanting to know in what ways they can be brought to fruition, well... It was then that I figured out exactly what to do with my career. The most satisfying thing in life for me is the glow of happiness I am able to bring my clients at the end of every appointment once I brought their conceptualization to life. I am a licensed hair and makeup artist located in the greater Boston area. I currently hold a cosmetology license in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts, specializing in commercial, beauty, fashion and weddings/special events. I trained at a Paul Mitchell Cosmetology school in New Hampshire gaining skills of beauty techniques and sanitation. In addition to providing services, I am looking for opportunities to work with photographers, models and fashion stylists to test with and create new work together. I am also looking for assisting opportunities with seasoned makeup artists and hair stylists. Go to Website for [more](www.nikkyatkinson.format.com)&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;With over 8 years of experience as a makeup artist , I&#39;ve learned all types of makeup including special effects, theatrical and beauty but my heart went to weddings. I love the environment of when brides are about to step in one of the biggest journeys of their life and I get to be a part of that. I have been married for 8 years to an amazing man and my biggest accomplishment is our 6 year old daughter whom my world revolves around. I received my makeup artist certification from  the Makeup School  of Candice Mack in Strasbourg, France in 2015 . I furthered my education by becoming a licensed Esthetician in 2022. I am also a certified lash and nail technician. Over the past few years, the natural makeup look has been my signature style that brides request but I can certainly do it all and enjoy a full glam! Whatever you have in mind we will work together to achieve it. I want you to feel yourself, feel comfortable andconfident! Go to Website for [more](www.lafrenchtouchbyemilie.com)&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Our photo booth package includes delivery/setup/teardown of an enclosed or open-air Photo Booth, a dedicated Booth Attendant to assist your guests and make sure everything is running smoothly, unlimited printed photo strips throughout the event, customization of the strips to include the Bride and Groom&#39;s names and the wedding date, a selection of props your guests can use to dress up for their photos, use of our unique iPad kiosk where guests can email or text photos anywhere they would like right from the event, a USB thumb drive that contains all the images taken, and an online password-protected photo gallery where your guests can download their photos even after the event. A lot of our colleagues have moved to digital only booths (to save money on ink and paper) but we are still printing Photo Strips while also offering digital options (text and email). Also, we use only DSLR cameras for the best picture quality while some companies have moved to iPad booths for convenience and cost savings at the expense of quality.
