  <meta name="description" content="Our photo booth package includes delivery/setup/teardown of an enclosed or open-air Photo Booth, a dedicated Booth Attendant to assist your guests and make sure everything is running smoothly, unlimited printed photo strips throughout the event, customization of the strips to include the Bride and Groom&#39;s names and the wedding date, a selection of props your guests can use to dress up for their photos, use of our unique iPad kiosk where guests can email or text photos anywhere they would like right from the event, a USB thumb drive that contains all the images taken, and an online password-protected photo gallery where your guests can download their photos even after the event. A lot of our colleagues have moved to digital only booths (to save money on ink and paper) but we are still printing Photo Strips while also offering digital options (text and email). Also, we use only DSLR cameras for the best picture quality while some companies have moved to iPad booths for convenience and cost savings at the expense of quality.
